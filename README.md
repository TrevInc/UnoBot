# UnoBot

UnoBot is an IRC bot written in Java. It has a pircbot back end, so it's easy to change settings. 
The bot connects to an IRC server/channel
and allows members of the channel to play a game of uno. It also has an AI so it can play too.

## Requirements

1. You must have Java 1.7 JDK or higher installed.
2. The Java bin folder must be in your classpath if you are running windows.

## Installation

1. open the config.ini file
2. edit the values appropriately
3. run the make script in UnoBot
4. run the UnoBot.jar using the 'java -jar UnoBot.jar' command

### values in the config file

        Server - if no value given it will default to localhost
		
        Port - if no value given it will default to 6667
        
		Channel - the channel the bot connects to default to #uno
        
		Nick - if no value given it will default to unoBot
        
		BotOps - if no value given it will default to null
			this should be a list separated by ',' and no spaces.
			the first user in this list should be the owner.
		
		UpdateScript - if an BotOps in the channel says "!update" 
			this script will run. if using a 'nix shell script
			a "./" may be required.
		
		ScoreBoardFileName - the name of the file you want the 
			score board to be saves to so when the unoBot exits
			it will still keep everyones score. If no value given it 
			default to "ScoreBoard.dat"
			
		Verbose - set this equal to true if you want the bot to print 
			out all actions verbosely, this is mainly used for debugging.
			If no value is given it will default to false.

        SSL - set this to true if you would like the bot to connect to
            the server using an SSL connection. The default is false.
